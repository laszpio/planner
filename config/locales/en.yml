    policy:
      intro: "There’s high demand for our workshops and we have a waiting list on most weeks. To make sure as many people as possible can come, we have a straightforward attendance policy."
      rule1: "Before you RSVP make sure you are eligible to attend. If you’re not sure get in touch for a chat."
      rule2: "You must sign up and RSVP to attend our workshops."
      rule3: "If you RSVP then later realise you can’t make it, you must cancel. It only takes a few seconds to do through your confirmation email."
      rule4: "Please try to cancel with at least 24 hours notice."
      rule5: "We know that sometimes things come up last minute, but even if you only cancel an hour before the session, get in touch and let us know."
      what_happens: "What happens if I don’t respect the policy?"
      strikes_system: "We operate a three strikes system. That means if you don’t come in without cancelling an RSVP three times, we will take you off our invite list for four weeks. We’ll get in touch after your first absence to make sure you understand this."
      removing: "If you fail to attend without cancelling another three times, we might have to remove you permanently from our invitation list."
      rsvping: "There is no penalty for RSVP-ing and then cancelling on a regular basis, but please avoid it. If you always struggle to make it in on a certain day then let us know – that kind of feedback is really important to us."
      eligibility_note: "Another note on eligibility"
      abuse: "We’re a fairly relaxed bunch and we trust you, so we don’t police students as to their eligibility. However if it ever looks like this is being abused we may have to change that – which we really don’t want to do."
      reminder: "So please remember what these workshops are for – to open up tech to people that are underrepresented in the industry."

    teacher_guide:
      laptop: "You don't need a laptop for our workshops. You are there to watch and guide the students. If you don't feel comfortable with the tutorial you should spend time on it before coming if you want to help out."
      keyboard: "Do not take over the keyboard! This can be off-putting and scary."
      typing: "Encourage the students to type and not copy paste."
      questions: "Explain that there are no dumb questions."
      mistakes: "Explain to students that it's ok to make mistakes."
      introduction: "Always introduce yourself. Say why you want to help out and are spending your own time on this, why you like programming."
      backgrounds: "Give your students the opportunity to get to know each other. Ask their names, why they are here, what they do in their day jobs. Encourage a brief discussion before starting."
      limits: "Assume that anyone you're teaching has no knowledge but infinite intelligence."
      colaboration: "Work collaboratively with your student. If you have two students, you should work with both. Don't focus all your attention on one of them."
      discussion: "Let students have a go at answering the questions first. Help with open and leading questions. Encourage a discussion."
      talk_slow: "Take it slow, you are the teacher, they are the student. Allow for time between questions."
      mild_approach: "Don't say no when the students are not doing something right. Be gentle, approach it in a mild way."
      paper: "Use pen and paper or go to a whiteboard! Often students are coming from a non-technical background. Drawing and explaining with visual material is really helpful."
      stubling: "Let them stumble. We learn by making mistakes, getting frustrated, and working through problem in our own way. Be supportive, but let them explore."
      suggestions: "Do you have something to suggest? Make a <a href='https://github.com/codebar/planner'>pull request</a> or <a href='https://github.com/codebar/planner/issues/new'>create an issue</a>"

    eligibility:
      q: "I want to attend a workshop. Am I eligible?"
      a: "Our workshops are available to women, LGBTQ and people who are underrepresented in the tech industry. If you belong to one of these groups, you are more than welcome to attend.

    career:
      q: "Is Codebar only aimed at people who want to move into a career as a developer?"

      a: "Yes, we suggest that you bring a laptop as it will be easier for you to carry on working on things after the workshops. It you don't have one, <a href=\"mailto:contact@codebar.io\">send us an email</a> so we can try and help out."
